# Welcome

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what exactly is reinforcement learning? Well, reinforcement learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on solving controlled tasks.  
But where does reinforcement learning fit in the big picture of machine learning?  
Well, as you probably know, machine learning, which is the branch of artificial intelligence that uses patterns in the data to solve a problem, can be divided into three different paradigms. That is, three ways of learning to solve those tasks.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is called supervised learning, and in this paradigm, we, the engineers who designed the algorithms, are responsible for feeding into the algorithm.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way to teach an artificial intelligence system called unsupervised learning. If we train an algorithm in this way, we are only going to give the algorithm information about the problem and not the solution like we did before.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as you know, this course is about reinforcement learning, which is the third way of training an artificial intelligence system. Using a reinforcement learning approach, the algorithm would learn only based on experience. That is our algorithm would face a problem by trial and error, learn from its mistakes. And through that learning process, it would become capable of performing that task optimally.
